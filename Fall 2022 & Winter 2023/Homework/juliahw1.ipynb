    "Random numbers, in Julia, are not truly \"random\". They are instead generated by an algorithm that uses a \"seed\", which is an initital value for the algoirthm. In future homeworks, we will set the random seed manually, so that we are able to automatically grade your code output, even when the code inputs are ostensibly random. This property is also good for you - it would be difficult, to say the least, to diagnose issues in your code's output if your input changes every time you run the cell! Here is a demonstration: the following cell generates a random number based on a seed, and will generate the random number <code>-0.5560268761463861</code> every time you run it. If you comment out line 2, then you'll get a different random number each time."
