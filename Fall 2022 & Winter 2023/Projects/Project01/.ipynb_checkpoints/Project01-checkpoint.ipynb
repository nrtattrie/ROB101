As you will notice from the figure you just made for one second of data, LiDAR scans collected over 1 second are not enough to give us full scene understanding and we therefore need to fuse multiple scans together for a more vivid picture. As much as we would like to give you the full data set and have this be as impressive as the Cassie video, due to time constraints, we are going to have you work with only five seconds (time = 9 to 13 seconds) instead of three minutes of data.\n",

The transformation has to be continuously estimated in real-time on the robot. That part of the problem you can learn about in ROB 330, ROB 501 and ROB 530. There is an entire research area that focuses on calculating the best approximate transformations from the moving LiDAR to the fixed world frame. \n",
