# Robotics 101: Computational Linear Algebra

Computational Linear Algebra is a first-semester, first-year undergraduate course that shows how mathematics and computation are unified for reasoning about data and making discoveries about the world.

The first iteration of the course ran in Fall 2020 at the University of Michigan Robotics Institute.

Linear algebra and coding are rapidly becoming an essential foundation for the modern engineer in a computational world.  Students in this course will gain insights into the mathematical theory of linear algebra and its realization in practical computational tools. 

Math is the language of engineering, but coding is believing and realizing it. The mathematical content of ROB 101 is built around systems of linear equations, their representation as matrices, and numerical methods for their analysis. These methods will be given life through the lens of robotics and contemporary intelligent systems and their compelling applications.

The entire course is available for the terms:
